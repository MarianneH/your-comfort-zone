# your-comfort-zone

This project is done within the Wild Code School 20 week bootcamp course.

We want to create a website that allows users to flee from bad news. Therefore we want to filter the news from the Guardian (through Newscatcher API) to only present positive news.

We are decorating the news with additional comforting element. Like a look into space (via NASA API), cute fox image, Sudokus, Music and so on.
