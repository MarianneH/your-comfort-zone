# your-comfort-zone

This project is done within the Wild Code School 20 week bootcamp course.

We want to create a website that allows users to flee from bad news. Therefore we want to filter the news from the Guardian (through Newscatcher API https://newscatcherapi.com/ ) to only present positive news.

We are decorating the news with additional comforting elements. Like a look into space (via NASA API), cute fox images, Sudokus, Music and so on.
